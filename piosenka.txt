Chorus 1 In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shananananana knees, knees
Ohh, I wanna watch you bleed!

Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl that's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get them for free

Chorus 2 In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Ohh, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here everyday
Ya learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want but you better not take it from me

Repeat Chorus 1

And when you're high you never, ever wanna come down
So down, so down, so down... yeahh!


You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby,
You're gonna die!

Chorus 3 In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shananananana knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shananananana knees, knees
Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down, huh!
